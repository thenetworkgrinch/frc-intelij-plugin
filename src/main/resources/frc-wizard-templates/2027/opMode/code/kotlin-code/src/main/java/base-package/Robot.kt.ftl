    IMPORTANT: This template uses alternate square bracket interpolation syntax
               For example:
                    [=data.robotClassSimpleName]
               rather than:
                    ${data.robotClassSimpleName}
               so as to not clash with Kotlin string templates syntax
               The option to use that can't be set in the template, but has to be set as an
               option on the Configuration object in the code. Note that this only affects interpolation
               syntax, and *NOT* Tag syntax. So we will still use `<#if isSuchAndSuch>` and not `[#if isSuchAndSuch]`.
               Tag syntax can be changed if desired, but we are not.

/**
 * The functions in this object (which basically functions as a singleton class) are called automatically
 * as described in the OpModeRobot documentation. OpMode classes anywhere in the package (or sub-packages)
 * where this object is located are automatically registered to display in the Driver Station.
 * This is written as an object rather than a class since there should only ever be a single instance, and
 * it cannot take any constructor arguments. This makes it a natural fit to be an object in Kotlin.
 *
 * If you change the name of this object or its package after creating this project, you must also update
 * the `Main.kt` file in the project. (If you use the IDE's Rename or Move refactorings when renaming the
 * object or package, it will get changed everywhere.)
